Plan
----

Tesla Demo - 6 hours tops, but at noon hard stop.
Lunch
CS - 5+ hours 
Tesla Presentation - 2 hours (as a break)
Dinner
Car Rev A - ADC, I2C, ... place, test. See Dan's code.
E11 review - 15'', word-pdf edit.
Check Amma's wake timing. Sleep 6 hours beforehand.

health, google+study, tesla+study, job search, and trips put off.

Demo Plan
---------

Sunday
------
DAC system s/w test -> works. 
DAC system h/w test with LED instead of PMOD JA1 -> works
Leave PMOD test till later, maybe try a few other PMOD ports and check with a scope.

ADC design review

Monday
------
implement, test 
ADC system test in s/w 

Floorplanning

DAC system test in h/w with PMOD 
ADC system test in h/w (set up adc on breadboard, sample periodically 4 pots, drive led's, buttons set channels)

Preamp parts list + schematic 
Postamp parts list + schematic 

Tuesday
------
Build pre/post amps (x4, x2)
Build mic/headphone setup

Verify pre-amp in lab with ADC system test.
Verify post-amp with DAC system test in h/w (get caps, small R from lab)

Wednesday, Thursday 
-------------------
Full system wiring + review. 
Full system test in h/w.

ADC

Notes:
	Need to latch and display on some pins the 2 MSB to make sure we aren't hitting them during calibration.
	Takes 5 V supply, so use 5V to 3.3 V converter.
	Use soldered male pins for PMOD connections.
	0-5 V / 1024 and wanting 255 LSB means we want 0-1.25V centered at 0.5 V as "128," the DC bias.
		Use a 5 V LDO off the 9V rail for the ADC
	Let's make the pre-amp run off the 9V supply and AC couple things, and run the mics off the 3.3 LDO on board

Verify timing diagram for FSM including logic level conversion
