Demo Plan
---------

DAC system s/w test -> works? Never tested properly..
DAC system h/w test with LED instead of PMOD JA1 -> works, visually.
DAC system h/w test with PMOD output - scope verified, but weird periodic spiking 	
		0.1uF cap really, really cleans it up and it looks like a square wave.
Trying 400Hz waveform.

Wednesday
---------

Floorplanning for:
DAC system test in h/w with PMOD 
ADC system test in h/w (set up adc on breadboard, sample periodically 4 pots, drive led's, buttons set channels)
	(1.5 hours)

Preamp parts list + schematic 
Postamp parts list + schematic 
	(30 minutes)

Build pre/post amps (x4, x2)
	(1 hour)
Build mic/headphone setup
	(1 hour)

Verify pre-amp in lab with ADC system test
	(30 minutes)
Verify post-amp with DAC system test in h/w
	(30 minutes)

Full system wiring + review
	(1 hour)

Thursday 
-------------------
Full system test in h/w.

ADC

Notes:
	Need to latch and display on some pins the 2 MSB to make sure we aren't hitting them during calibration.
	Takes 5 V supply, so use 5V to 3.3 V converter.
	Use soldered male pins for PMOD connections.
	0-5 V / 1024 and wanting 255 LSB means we want 0-1.25V centered at 0.5 V as "128," the DC bias.
		Use a 5 V LDO off the 9V rail for the ADC
	Let's make the pre-amp run off the 9V supply and AC couple things, and run the mics off the 3.3 LDO on board
	User resistive divider for INT and the conveter for the data bus (8 bits). 
	Condfirm the rest, 3.3 will be fine for 5 V inputs?

Verify timing diagram for FSM including logic level conversion
	Need to modify state diagram.
