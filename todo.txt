Demo Plan
---------

DAC system s/w test -> works? Never tested properly..
DAC system h/w test with LED instead of PMOD JA1 -> works, visually.
DAC system h/w test with PMOD output - scope verified, but weird periodic spiking 	
90Hz (220uF, 8Ohm) output filter (remove DC) + 1.58 MHz high kill filter.
At PMOD output, 0.1uF cap really, really cleans it up and it looks like a square wave
but this is a 1/sC filter and introduces significant gain distortion.

Placed 5V LDO on board. Looks like wall adapter output is 12V, not 9V as it says..

Trying 400Hz waveform. Works. 2.56 ms period. with or without 0.1uF cap sounds good.
Trying 800Hz -> noticed gain distortion. But works.

Rebuilding separate 400, 800 Hz files without 0.1uF 1/sC filter, to see if
gain distortion disappears. Yes. Close enough. 2V, 1.9V p-p for both.

Next step is to do the same for 4 kHz
Sound level at 255 is definitely loud enough for a first pass. 
The DAC circuit is validated if 4 kHz works. Yep, 1.6V p-p, so a bit of a drop.

Bug: Ignoring the periodic 1V spiking (we'll deal with it later)
Bug: Ignoring the source of the LPF in the current circuit.. 

Proceed to ADC. 

Floorplanning for:
ADC system test in h/w (set up adc on breadboard, sample periodically 1 pot, rest grounded. drive led's, buttons set channels.
	Top 2 bits are driving leds with 10K resistors to make sure don't overload ADC outputs (360uA is pushing it)

Preamp parts list + schematic -> IN PROGRESS
Postamp parts list + schematic -> DONE	

Build & test pre/post amps in h/w (x4, x2)
	(1 hour)
Build mic/headphone setup
	(1 hour)

Test mic/headphone setup in oscilloscope just for noise at ends of pre-amp.

Full calibration system wiring in s/w, calibrate
	(1 hour)

Full system wiring in s/w, burn in and test.


Notes for ADC/System Rails:
	Need to latch and display on some pins the 2 MSB to make sure we aren't hitting them during calibration.
	Takes 5 V supply, so use 5V to 3.3 V logic converter.
	Use soldered male pins for PMOD connections.
	0-5 V / 1024 and wanting 255 LSB means we want 0-1.25V centered at 0.5 V as "128," the DC bias.
		Use a 5 V LDO off the 12V rail for the ADC and the DAC.
	Let's make the pre-amp run off the 12V supply and AC couple things, and run the mics off the 5V LDO on board as before.
	Use a resistive divider for INT and the conveter for the data bus (8 bits). 
	Condfirm the rest, 3.3 will be fine for 5 V inputs, yes.
